# Miro
Description

The MIRo robot is a low cost bio-mimetic robot designed as a ‘companion robot’. The robot is based on a pet dog and has a pair of microphones mounted inside moveable ears. We have been working with an especially adapted 8-microphone version of the robot for which we will be developing machine listening algorithms.

The aim of this project is to build an automatic speech recognition system for the MIRo robot. This will involve three main steps: i) processing existing speech training data to simulate the effect of it being recorded with the MIRo robot; ii) using the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit to train a speech recognition system adapted to the MIRo robot; iii) evaluating the system using speech data captured by the robot. The project may also investigate the use of microphone ‘beamforming’ techniques to build a recogniser that can work well in noisy environments (e.g., when the robot is moving an generating motor noise).

The project will make use of measurement that have already been made of the robot motor noise and microphone behaviour.
